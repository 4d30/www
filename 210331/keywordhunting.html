	People develop skills over time, usually lots of them.
	Unfortunately, hiring managers don't have the time, energy, or need to hear about each and every skill you've developed over your lifetime.
	When it comes to choosing which skills to list on a resume it is best practice to list the skills which one posesses that are related to the position.
