  I've relocated to the East Coast after living in British Columbia. 
  I am seeking a job in Data Science. My skills are many and some notable ones are:
  <ul>
   <li>Python Programming
   <li>Statistical Analysis
   <li>Training and evaluating ML models
   <li>Developing optimization models
   <li>Reporting and presentation
   <li>Willing to work. Hard.

  I just completed a study of a common business problem.
  The purpose of the study was to determine the best place to open a diner in Brooklyn NY to target the hipster demographic.
  Brooklyn is a very competitive marketplace and without data it'd be guesswork.

  In summary, the borough was hexagonally tessellated into neighborhoods.
  Relevant venues were fetched from Foursquare's <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/"> Places API</a> in each neighborhood.
  Neighborhoods were clustered with DBSCAN and then modeled with a cost-function.
  Multiple locations were found to be suitable.
  Interestingly, hip areas like Park Slope and South Slope did not make the list.

 <p>
 I graduated High School in 2007. 
 At the time, I felt pretty purposeless and started taking classes at my local community college without much other direction. 
 In spring semester I was enrolled in a science lecture and lab. 
 In between these two classes there was a three hour break.
 One day a classmate from science class invited myself and some others back to his house for the break.
 I accepted the offer and a few of us left campus.
 <p>
 
 When we arrived, Jerry Springer was entertaining an empty house.
 It was decorated as typical middle-class suburban homes are.
 My host made a rather large bong appear which is impressive at that age.
 We were all generously offered some tobacco to smoke.
 The bong was passed around the room until we were all dizzy and hungry.
 Maury took over for Jerry.
 <br>
 At this time, my host made a can of air-duster appear.
 It was offered to us classmates just as the tobacco was.
 <br>
 That next fall, I began a four-year physics program at a small liberal arts college.
